# TN_test_Lem_in

The purpose of this series of shell scripts is to provide tests for the lem_in project.
Lem_in is a program that finds the quickest way to get n ants across a graph ([Subject here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1wlvsos3fg2w5ju/lem-in.en.pdf?dl=0))

It tests 100+ relevant examples of invalid text inputs, as well as memory leaks using valgrind.

## Installing & running the tests

To install it, simply put the content of the TN_test_GNL folder in your lem_in folder, then do :

```
sh TN_test_GNL.sh
```
## Disclaimer

The definition of "invalid" is debatable. Make sure you check the logs.
